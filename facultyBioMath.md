content_title: Program Description
content_description: "Biology is the study of life. The programs offered by the Department of Biology provide students with an introduction to the broad spectrum of Biological Sciences in contrast to more specialized programs in Biochemistry, Microbiology, Physiology and Anatomy and Cell Biology. This Joint Major program is built on a selection of mathematics and biology courses that recognize mathematical biology as a field of research, with three streams within biology: Ecology and Evolutionary Ecology, Molecular Evolution, and Neurosciences. This program provides a solid background for those interested in careers related to environmental protection, wildlife management, biotechnology and genetic engineering. A B.Sc. degree in Biology can also lead to post-graduate studies, entry to professional schools in medicine, veterinary science, dentistry, agriculture, nursing, education and library science, and research careers in universities, research institutes, hospitals, and industrial or governmental laboratories."
