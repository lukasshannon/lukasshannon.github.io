content_title: Program Description
content_description: "Life Sciences are becoming increasingly quantitative and analytical, and integrative. This program will train students in the fundamentals of biology - with a focus on molecular biology - and will give them computational and mathematical skills needed to manage, analyze, and model large biological datasets. Two integrative features of the program are a three-credit joint independent studies course, and a one-credit seminar. The program fills an important gap in the undergraduate programs at McGill, as no existing program allows students to get a solid training in these two increasingly interconnected fields."
